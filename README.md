## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
The COVID-19 Global Data Insights: A Relational Database Approach project is designed to track and analyze key COVID-19 metricsâ€”cases, deaths, hospitalizations, testing, and vaccinationsâ€”across multiple countries from 2020 to 2023. 
This relational database uses foreign key relationships to maintain data integrity and structure, allowing users to gain comprehensive insights into the pandemic's global impact.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to create a comprehensive SQL database that effectively stores, manages, and analyzes COVID-19 data while maintaining relational integrity across countries, dates, and key pandemic metrics. 
The database supports efficient queries to extract meaningful insights and track trends.

## Key Highlights

**Comprehensive Data Tracking:** The project tracks COVID-19 cases, deaths, hospitalizations, vaccinations, and testing metrics across multiple countries over a span of four years (2020-2023).

**Relational Database Design:** Built using a relational database model, ensuring efficient organization and structured analysis of global COVID-19 data.

**Foreign Key Relationships:** Foreign keys are used to maintain integrity between core tables (countries, dates, and case metrics), enabling accurate and flexible querying.

**Scalable Data Structure:** The design supports adding more countries, dates, and metrics with ease, making the database highly scalable.

**Efficient Querying:** The structured database enables efficient querying of trends and insights, such as total cases per country, positivity rates, and vaccination progress.

**Data Integrity:** The use of foreign key constraints ensures that data is consistent and free of duplication or errors.

**Real-World Application:** The project can be extended to analyze pandemic data for various timeframes, providing insights into health policy and responses to global pandemics.


## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how a relational database can be used to track the spread and impact of COVID-19 across multiple countries. 
By storing detailed data on cases, testing, deaths, hospitalizations, and vaccinations, the database enables rich analysis, such as comparing the pandemic's effects in different regions and calculating key metrics like test positivity rates.
